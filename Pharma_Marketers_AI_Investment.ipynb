        "\n",
        "Understanding the skillset compositions in specific industries is crucial for aligning educational programs, workforce development, and policy-making with industry needs. The following literature review summarizes scholarly research that examines skill requirements, skill gaps, and the impact of technological advancements across various industries.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Summary:**  \n",
        "This study analyzes skill requirements in U.S. manufacturing by surveying employers. The team conducts a nationally representative survey of U.S. manufacturing establishments. It challenges the notion of widespread skill shortages and provides insights into the specific skills demanded in modern manufacturing settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "This study contributes to the discussion of AI in pharma marketing by examining how skill demands and mismatch in the manufacturing sector provide insights into the broader question of skill gaps in technologically advanced industries, including pharma. By analyzing survey data on skill demands and hiring difficulties, the study emphasizes the need for specific technical and digital competencies, which are often central to AI adoption. While the focus is on manufacturing, the methodology and findings are relevant to understanding skill demands in the pharma marketing domain, particularly in AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "The study reveals that challenges in hiring skilled workers are not purely a result of a lack of broad education or workforce training but can also be mediated by factors like firm strategy, technology adoption, and specific skill requirements. These findings imply that in the context of AI in pharma marketing, investments in targeted skills and competencies are essential, as is an understanding of how these skills align with business strategies and technological shifts. The insights point to the importance of focusing on firm-level strategies, tailored training solutions, and improved institutional relationships rather than general workforce inadequacies.\n",
        "\n",
        "The research examines how different establishment characteristics (e.g., being part of a high-tech industry, membership in industry clusters) influence skill demands and hiring difficulties. This approach uncovers whether specific types of firms with higher skill demands face greater signs of mismatch, helping to understand the broader context of skill needs within the industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "The study analyzes the relationship between skill demands and high-performance work system (HPW) variables, such as Total Quality Management (TQM) and self-managed work teams. By measuring the percentage involvement of core workers in these systems, the study assesses how workplace organization and management practices correlate with skill requirements and hiring challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "The study uses logistic regression (logit models) to estimate the relationship between various skill demands and the presence of long-term vacancies in core production roles. This approach allows for the calculation of the likelihood that certain skill demands predict hiring difficulties, providing insights into the factors contributing to skill gaps.\n",
